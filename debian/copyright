Nettle is distributed under the GNU General Public License. However,
most of the individual files are dual licensed under less restrictive
licenses like the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), or are in
the public domain. This means that if you don't use the parts of
nettle that are GPL-only, you have the option to use the Nettle
library just as if it were licensed under the LGPL. To find the
current status of particular files, you have to read the copyright
notices at the top of the files.
